# I Like Paintings

I Like Paintings is a Python package that can predict the painting appreciation (if people like or not the painting) from the image using a linear regressor trained on top of a frozen CLIP features extractor model on two paintings appreciation datasets. The package contains pre-trained weights for nine models on two datasets (VAPS-999 and Sidhu's one).
All linear predictors in this package assume that their input embeddings are L2 normalized.

## Installation

You can install I Like Paintings via pip:

```bash
pip install ilikepaintings
```


## Usage
To use the package, you need to load the weights of the linear regressor. Here is an example code snippet:

```python
from ilikepaintings import load_predictor, VALID_MODELS, VALID_DATASETS

# Choose a model and dataset
clip_model_name = VALID_MODELS[0]
dataset_name = VALID_DATASETS[0]

# Load the predictor
predictor = load_predictor(clip_model_name, dataset_name)
```

For a fully working example on a real painting, look at `demo.ipynb` or try on [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/VieVie31/i-like-paintings/blob/master/demo.ipynb) !



## Benchmark

The following table shows the cross-validation scores (`k=5`) of the linear model with the best hyper-parameters, measured using the Pearson correlation coefficient. 
These scores were obtained for each CLIP model backend and dataset. The final released models were retrained using the same hyper-parameters and fitted on the whole dataset.
All embeddings are L2 normalized.
